# duck-stack — Global Specification

Living index of the functional state of each module. For the full specification of a module see `duck-spec/modules/<module>/SPEC.md`.

## infra

**Status:** Base monorepo scaffolded.

The repository is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo. It contains three applications (`apps/web`, `apps/landing`, `apps/services`) and three shared packages (`@repo/tsconfig`, `@repo/eslint-config`, `@repo/types`). The Turborepo pipeline coordinates `build`, `dev`, and `lint` across all workspaces in dependency order.

See `duck-spec/modules/infra/SPEC.md` for full details.

## web

**Status:** Base structure in place.

`apps/web` is a Vite + React + TypeScript SPA organised into strict layer directories (`api/`, `hooks/`, `pages/`, `components/ui/`, `components/domain/`, `store/`, `lib/`). The entry point wires React Query via `QueryClientProvider` and two Zustand stores (`useSessionStore`, `useUiStore`) are available for session and UI state. A shared HTTP client (`api/client.ts`) wraps `fetch` with an optional auth-header placeholder. A working health-check vertical slice (`api/health.ts` → `hooks/useHealth.ts` → `pages/health/HealthPage.tsx`) serves as the canonical layering reference.

See `duck-spec/modules/web/SPEC.md` for full details.

## landing

**Status:** Base structure in place.

`apps/landing` is a Vite + React + TypeScript marketing SPA. Its source is organised into `components/layout/`, `components/sections/`, `components/ui/`, `pages/`, `api/`, and `lib/`. Layout components (`Navbar`, `Footer`) and three independent marketing sections (`Hero`, `Features`, `CTA`) are composed into a single `HomePage` rendered at `/`. UI primitives (`Button`, `Badge`) have no dependencies beyond React. A stub `api/contact.ts` resolves without a network call. React Router handles routing with a catch-all redirect to `/` for unknown paths.

See `duck-spec/modules/landing/SPEC.md` for full details.

## services

**Status:** Fastify base structure in place; postgres.js direct database client in use; environment configuration centralized under typed config objects; file naming normalized to lowercase camelCase throughout; request-bound logger propagated across all module layers.

`apps/services` exposes a `GET /health` endpoint and implements a simplified hexagonal architecture with vertical slicing. Shared infrastructure (logger, postgres.js client, error handler, CORS, helmet) is wired once in `src/app.ts`; feature modules register routes as Fastify plugins. All database operations run via a `postgres.js` singleton (`shared/infrastructure/db.ts`) connected to Postgres over TCP — no HTTP intermediary. `@supabase/supabase-js` is not a runtime dependency. All environment variables are consumed through typed configuration objects under `src/shared/configs/` (`serverConfig.ts`, `authConfig.ts`, `mobbexConfig.ts`); no application code reads `process.env` directly except the two documented bootstrap exceptions (`db.ts` for `DATABASE_URL` and `clerkAuthPlugin` for `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`). Every file under `src/` uses lowercase camelCase naming with no dot-separated suffixes (other than `.ts` and `.test.ts`) and no hyphens — plugin, entity, and DTO files all conform to this convention. Every log line emitted during an HTTP request carries the Fastify-assigned `requestId`: handlers pass `request.log` as an explicit `pino.BaseLogger` parameter to use case `execute` methods, which forward it to all repository methods that emit log lines; webhook dispatcher functions (`dispatchMobbexEvent`, `dispatchClerkEvent`) follow the same pattern. Code outside the request scope uses the static logger from `shared/infrastructure/logger.ts`.

See `duck-spec/modules/services/SPEC.md` for full details.

## billing

**Status:** Payment provider port and Mobbex adapter implemented (BILLING-001). Checkout and transaction records implemented (BILLING-002). Payment webhooks implemented (BILLING-003). Refunds reflection implemented (BILLING-004).

The billing module exposes a `PaymentProvider` port in `@repo/types` with five operations: `createCheckout`, `queryTransaction`, `createSubscription`, `cancelSubscription`, and `verifyWebhook`. The active provider is resolved at boot time via `resolveProvider()` reading `BILLING_PROVIDER` (default `mobbex`); the service refuses to start if the provider is unknown or credentials are missing. `MobbexProvider` is the only implemented adapter, targeting the Mobbex HTTP API (Argentina/LATAM market). Provider errors are mapped to `ProviderError` (`statusCode 502` for upstream failures, `400` for validation errors).

The `transactions` Supabase table persists all payment attempts with columns for `id` (uuid PK, also used as the provider `reference`), `user_id`, `org_id`, `provider`, `provider_transaction_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `status` (`pending` | `approved` | `failed` | `refunded`), `description`, `reference` (unique), `checkout_url`, `metadata`, `failure_reason`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. Three authenticated endpoints are exposed: `POST /billing/checkout` creates a pending transaction row before calling the provider and returns `{ checkoutUrl, transactionId }`; `GET /billing/transactions/:id` returns the full transaction record for the owning user or org; `GET /billing/transactions` returns a cursor-paginated list ordered by `created_at DESC`. All three routes enforce authentication via the `requireAuth` preHandler. The local transaction `id` serves as the end-to-end idempotency key sent as `reference` to the provider. An optional `Idempotency-Key` request header enables safe retries — if a matching transaction exists for the requester, the existing record is returned without a new DB write or provider call. Transactions are scoped to the authenticated `user_id`; when the JWT carries `orgId` the transaction is also associated with `org_id`. Input validation uses Zod (`amount > 0`, `currency` in `['ARS', 'USD']`, `description` non-empty); the listing endpoint accepts `limit` (default 20, max 100) and cursor-based pagination via a `cursor` query parameter encoding a `(created_at, id)` pair. Shared types `Transaction`, `TransactionStatusValue`, `CreateCheckoutInput`, and `TransactionListResponse` are exported from `@repo/types`. A frontend API client in `apps/web/src/api/billing.ts` exposes `createCheckout`, `getTransaction`, and `listTransactions` functions using `apiFetch`.

`POST /webhooks/billing/mobbex` receives asynchronous payment outcome notifications from Mobbex. The endpoint is registered before `clerkAuthPlugin` and is not subject to JWT verification. Authenticity is enforced via a `?secret=` query parameter compared against `MOBBEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; the plugin throws at registration time if the variable is absent. Every verified event is persisted in the `billing_webhook_events` Supabase table (`id`, `provider`, `event_type`, `payload` jsonb, `received_at`, `transaction_id` nullable FK, `subscription_id` nullable reserved for future use). On receipt of a checkout success or failure event, the handler resolves the local transaction by `provider_transaction_id` (falling back to `reference`) and updates `transactions.status` to `approved` or `failed`. On receipt of a `refund.success` or `refund.failure` event, the dispatcher calls `MobbexBillingSyncRepository.upsertRefundAndMaybeMarkTransactionRefunded`, which upserts a row in the `refunds` table keyed by `provider_refund_id` and — if the cumulative approved-refund amount equals the parent transaction amount — atomically transitions `transactions.status` to `refunded` within a single `sql.begin` block. Status updates are idempotent throughout: duplicate events produce no inconsistent state. If no matching transaction is found, the event is still recorded with `transaction_id = NULL` and the endpoint returns HTTP 200. All database access is centralized in `MobbexBillingSyncRepository` under `src/modules/webhooks/repositories/`.

The `refunds` Supabase table persists every provider-reported refund event with columns `id` (uuid PK), `transaction_id` (FK → `transactions.id` ON DELETE CASCADE), `amount`, `reason` (nullable), `status` (`pending` | `approved` | `failed`), `provider_refund_id` (UNIQUE), `created_at`, and `updated_at`. `GET /billing/transactions/:id/refunds` (authenticated via `requireAuth`) returns the refunds for a transaction ordered by `created_at ASC`; it returns 404 if the transaction does not exist and 403 if it belongs to a different scope. No endpoint in this module triggers a refund against the provider — refund creation flows exclusively from provider-initiated webhook events. Shared types `RefundStatusValue` and `Refund` are exported from `@repo/types`.

See `duck-spec/modules/billing/SPEC.md` for full details.

## subscriptions

**Status:** Plans catalog implemented (SUBS-001). Subscribe/cancel flow, lifecycle webhooks, frontend UI, and entitlement gates are planned.

The module exposes `GET /billing/plans` (no auth required), which returns the active subscription plan catalog ordered by price ascending. Plans are persisted in the `subscription_plans` Supabase table and seeded with three entries: `free` (price `0`), `pro`, and `business`. Each plan carries a nullable `provider_plan_id` for future linkage to the external payment provider. The `SubscriptionPlan` interface is published from `@repo/types` for use by both backend and frontend.

See `duck-spec/modules/subscriptions/SPEC.md` for full details.

## auth

**Status:** Clerk integration implemented; Supabase schema and webhook sync in place; user profile endpoints and page implemented; mandatory onboarding gate implemented.

Clerk is the end-to-end identity provider. `apps/web` renders Clerk's `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, `<CreateOrganization />`, and `<OrganizationProfile />` components at their respective routes. An `AuthGuard` component redirects unauthenticated users to `/sign-in` and gates all protected routes on onboarding completion. `useCurrentUser` and `useCurrentOrg` hooks wrap Clerk's `useUser` and `useOrganization`. `apps/services` verifies Clerk JWTs locally via a global Fastify plugin (`clerk-auth.plugin.ts`) using a cached JWKS key — no per-request Clerk API call. Requests are decorated with `userId` and `orgId`; `requireAuth` and `requireOrg` preHandlers enforce 401/403 at the route level. Organization multi-tenancy is opt-in: no route requires `orgId` at the starter level. Supabase holds local mirrors of Clerk identity data in three tables (`users`, `organizations`, `organization_members`), kept in sync via `POST /webhooks/clerk` in `apps/services` — a Svix-verified webhook endpoint that handles `user.created`, `user.updated`, `organization.created`, and `organizationMembership.created` events with idempotent upsert semantics. `GET /users/me` returns the full user profile including `job_role`, `company_size`, `primary_use_case`, and `onboarding_completed`. `PATCH /users/me` accepts only `locale` and `timezone`. `POST /users/me/onboarding` atomically persists the three segmentation fields and sets `onboarding_completed = true`. A `/profile` page and an `/onboarding` page in `apps/web` handle profile editing and first-access onboarding respectively; `AuthGuard` redirects users with `onboarding_completed = false` to `/onboarding` before rendering any other protected page.

See `duck-spec/modules/auth/SPEC.md` for full details.
